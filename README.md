p5.js snake tutorial spin-off

Followed along the video, with a few differences:
* Snake wraps around the canvas;
* Food is an object;
* Snake eating the food works a little bit different (food and snake squares have the same size, only check for same x and y);
* Tail is also different. Instead of shifting everything, I just pop the last square and put it in front of the tail.

TODO:
* Scoreboard;
* Reset everything when snake eats itself;
* Maybe a splashscreen?
* When snake fills entire screen, player wins
